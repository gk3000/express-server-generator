A generator for Express basic server which creates folders and files for the routes, controllers and models.

To build this we've used:

* node readline   https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html
* node filesystem https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
* javascript 

How to use it :

`npm i -g express-server-generator` to install it globally

From the folder where you want to create a new express server run `esg` and provide a name for the project, brief description and author name. 

Then enter the folder with your new project where you will see the file/folders structure and some starter code.
