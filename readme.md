A generator for Express basic server which creates folders and files for the routes, controllers and models.

To build this we've used:

* node readline   https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html
* node filesystem https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
* javascript 

How to use it :

1) cd express_generator
2) node app.js
3) then you'll be asked for project name, author and description
   (these data will be included in the package.json)
4) cd ${new project name}
5) npm install 
6) nodemon

All the templates used for the new projects to be generated are defined in this repo and could be changed by you in the app.js file and files/folders inside 'files' folder.
